# Revolutionizing-Farming-with-Drone-Technology
This project aims to empower farmers by leveraging drones and machine learning for early detection of crop diseases, helping reduce crop losses, minimize pesticide use, and promote sustainable agriculture practices.

 Project Overview
Agriculture faces significant challenges such as land constraints, plant diseases, pests, and water scarcity. Traditional farming methods often result in delayed disease detection, causing major crop losses.

Our solution integrates:

Drones to capture high-resolution crop images

Image Processing techniques

Machine Learning models (CNN, Decision Trees)
to detect diseases at an early stage and recommend actions to farmers.

🎯 Objectives
Early Disease Detection: Identify crop diseases before they spread widely.

Minimize Pesticide Usage: Guide targeted spraying instead of whole-field pesticide application.

Boost Productivity: Empower farmers with actionable insights to improve crop yield.

Promote Sustainable Farming: Balance modern technology with traditional farming wisdom.

🛠️ Methodology
Image Pre-processing:
Enhancing image features, noise reduction, sharpening, and edge detection.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):
For feature extraction and disease classification from images.

Decision Trees:
For intuitive classification and interpretation.

Drone Integration:
For surveying farmland and capturing disease-affected crop images.
